               <h2 class="titleText">About Plants</h2>
               <p>What are plants? Plants are living organisms that cover much of the land of planet Earth. You see them everywhere. They include grass, trees, flowers, bushes, ferns, mosses, and more. Plants are members of the kingdom plantae.<br><br>What makes a plant a plant?<br><br>Here are some basic characteristics that make a living organism a plant: Most plants make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. Plants have a cuticle, meaning they have a waxy layer on their surface that protects them and keeps them from drying out. They have eukaryotic cells with rigid cell walls. They reproduce with spores or with sex cells.<br><br></br>

               <p class="paragraph">Plant Cell</p> <br><br>Plant cells are composed of rigid cell walls made of cellulose, chloroplasts (which help with photosynthesis), a nucleus, and large vacuoles filled with water.</p><br>
               <p class="heading1">Types of Plants</p><br>
               <p>There are many different types of plants. They are typically divided into two major groups: vascular and nonvascular. <br><br> Vascular - These plants have specific tissues that help to move materials such as water through the plant. They are further divided into non-flowering plants and flowering plants. Most of the organisms you probably think of as plants, such as trees, bushes, and flowers, fit into this group. <br><br>Nonvascular - These are smaller plants, such as mosses, that use diffusion and osmosis to move material through the plant.</p> <br><br>
                <p class="heading2">Basic Structure of Plants</p><br>
                <p>Leaf - The leaf is an organ of a plant that is specialized for photosynthesis. Leaves capture energy from sunlight as well as collect carbon dioxide from the air. Many leaves are flat and thin in order to catch as much sunlight as possible. However, leaves come in many different shapes including long skinny needles that are found on pine trees.<br><br> Stem - The stem is the main structure that supports leaves and flowers. Stems have vascular tissues that move food and water around the plant to help it grow. Plants often store food in their stems. Roots - The roots of a plant grow underground. Roots help to keep the plant from falling over and gather water and minerals from the soil. Some plants store food in their roots. The two major types of roots are fibrous roots and taproots. Taproots tend to have one major root that grows very deep, while fibrous roots have many roots that grow in all directions.<br><br>

                 <p>Sedimentary rocks are recycled rocks formed by the deposition of fragments of material (sediment) that have been eroded and weathered from other parent rocks. They often consist of sand, pebbles, minerals and mud that’s been removed from the land by erosion, carried by rivers or blown by the wind and eventually deposited.</p>

For example granite is an igneous rock mostly made from different proportions of the minerals quartz, feldspar and mica as interlocked crystals; a sandstone is a sedimentary rock that can also contain quartz, feldspar and mica, but as grains compacted and cemented into each other.</mark></p>

                  <h3>Volcanic Eruption</h3>
                  <p> Volcanically triggered earthquakes have the potential to cause cracks, ground deformation, and damage to manmade structures. They typically are much smaller than earthquakes caused by non-volcanic sources. 
                  Volcanic-tectonic earthquakes (VTs) are, simply put, caused by slip on a fault near a volcano. Volcanoes are often found in areas of crustal weakness and the mass of the volcano its self adds to the regional strain.<br><br>Volcanically-caused long period earthquakes are produced by vibrations generated by the movement of magma or other fluids within the volcano. Pressure within the system increases and the surrounding rock fails, creating small earthquakes.</p>

                  <h3>Earthquakes</h3>
                  <p> An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. <br><br>Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can’t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock!.<br><br></p>

The region really only experiences three seasons, a hot dry summer between March and May known as tag-init, a wet season between June and November known as tag-ulan and a coller dry season between December and February known as tag-lamig. The Philippines weather patterns are created by the prevailing winds of the southwest monsoon (known as the habagat) from May to October and the northeast monsoon (known as the amihan) from November to early May.</mark><br><br>Average temperatures in the Philippines usually range between 21 °C (70 °F) and 32 °C (90 °F) with the average yearly temperature coming in at around 26.6 °C (79.9 °F). Temperatures can fluctuate between regions and depending on the season, however generally January is the coolest month while May is the warmest. The Philippines are also affected by typhoons, also known as bagyo, which occur between June and November. Really only affecting the Visayas, Cebu is the only tourist destination that is impacted by these conditions however, typhoons can result in significant damage in these areas or heavy rain across the rest of the country.</p>
